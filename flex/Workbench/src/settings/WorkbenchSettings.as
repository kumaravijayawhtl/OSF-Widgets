     * <a-2005> a census:Census ;

     * If the "globalAggregationProperty" is "census:year", then the value of
     * "census:year" will be used to aggregate the value of the property "foo:activePopulation"
     * in the sLinearChart based on the census year of the record.
     * 
     * This property is the same as defined in other semantic components such as the sLinearChart.
     * The same values have to be defined in each. These globalAggregationProperties become 
     * the x-axis of the sLinearChart.
     * 
     * All the properties definin a record, which have a sco:allowedValue of "Float" or "Integer"
     * can be used to get aggregated on a sLinearChart if one of the globalAggregationProperties
     * is also describing them.
